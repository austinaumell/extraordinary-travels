            <p id="fun"> We started way back in the early months of 2019. Our vision was to enable all people to
                experience world travels regardless of their income or abilites. We believe that there is rich stories
                to be told in new places. Learning more about places and the history that inhabits the area, as well as
                the species will enable people to care more about the place. Once they have a reason to care, people
                will become more actively involved in communitties.
